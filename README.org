* What is this
This is the homework of CS426 in SJTU. The requirement is in file:hw5.pdf .
Briefly, I write some python code using perceptron and KNN to deal with
a small 2-class classification problem and draw the graphs of decision boundaries.
There is no trick to speed up the performance so it will take a long time especially
in KNN algorithm.
